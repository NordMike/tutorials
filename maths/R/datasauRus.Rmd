```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(targets)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
# Specify the project thanks to 
Sys.setenv(TAR_PROJECT = "datasaurus")
```

By default each **target** is run inside a fresh R session (using `callr`) and thus no packages are loaded.
You can specify them for each or use a global 


This guided practical will demonstrate that the **tidyverse** allows to compute summary statistics and visualize datasets efficiently.
This dataset is already stored in a **tidy** `tibble`, cleaning steps will come in future practicals.

## `datasauRus` package


**targets** has its own machinery that `knitr` ([>= v1.34](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/releases/tag/v1.34)) now recognizes the `targets` keyword.

`tar_interactive` populates the **Global Env** if set to `TRUE`.

If executed, or during the knitting process, the `_targets_r` folder is created/updated with R script corresponding to the chunk name. Here `_targets_r/data.R` will contain the code in the chunk.


`tar_url()` will check if the data was updated since last visit

```{targets data, tar_interactive = FALSE}
library(tarchetypes)
library(dplyr)
tar_url(ds_file, "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lockedata/datasauRus/master/inst/extdata/DatasaurusDozen.tsv")
```

Now, a new script `_targets_r/read_data.R` is created. Both will be read by the main `_targets.R` that **Targets markdown** creates if absent.

```{targets read_data, tar_interactive = FALSE}
tar_target(ds, read_tsv(ds_file), packages = "readr")
```

`tar_simple` sets to `TRUE` allows to create a **targets** with the chunk name.


##### Reuse the above command, and now colored by the `dataset` column

```{targets first_plot, tar_simple = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(ds) + 
  aes(x, y, colour = dataset) +
  geom_point()
```

Rest of the plotting targets are written altogether. And are bundled using `list()`

```{targets plotting}
list(
  tar_target(dino, ds %>%
               filter(dataset == "dino") %>%
               ggplot() +
               aes(x, y) +
               geom_point(), 
             packages = "ggplot2"),
  tar_target(all_facets,
             ds %>%
               ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, colour = dataset)) +
               geom_point() +
               facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3),
             packages = "ggplot2")
)
```

```{r}
tar_visnetwork()
```


```{r}
tar_make()
```


```{r}
tar_visnetwork()
```


## Explore the dataset


```{r, echo = FALSE}
tar_read(ds) 
```


`tar_load()` will read the target object and name it with its name, populating the **Global Env**

```{r}
tar_load(ds)
```


## Check summary statistics per dataset

##### Compute both mean and standard deviation (sd) in one go using `across()`


```{r}
ds %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
  # across works with first on which columns and second on what to perform on selection
  # 2 possibilities to select columns
  # summarise(across(where(is.double), list(mean = mean, sd = sd)))
  # by default in 1.0.5, grouped variables are excluded from across
  # summarise(across(everything(), list(mean = mean, sd = sd)))
  summarise(across(c(x, y), list(mean = mean, sd = sd)))
```


all mean and sd are the same for the 13 datasets


## Plot the _datasauRus_

```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.asp = 1, solution = TRUE}
tar_read(first_plot)
```



##### Facet all datasets

```{r, solution = TRUE}
tar_read(all_facets)
```


##### Tweak the theme and use the `theme_void` and remove the legend

```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.asp = 1}
tar_read(all_facets) +
  theme_void()
```

##### Are the datasets actually that similar?


No ;) We were fooled by the summary stats



## Animation

Plots can be animated, see for example what can be done with [`gganimate`](https://gganimate.com/).
Instead of panels, **states** are made across `datasets` and **transitions** smoothed with an afterglow effect.
